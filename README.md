## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a final-year engineering student with a strong interest in front-end development and data‑driven products. [web:129]  
I enjoy turning ideas into realistic UIs, and lately into **small analytical tools** that explain what the data is saying. [web:89]

---

## 🔭 What I’m Currently Working On

- Building front-end projects using React, Tailwind CSS and vanilla JavaScript  
- Exploring how dashboards can **tell stories** instead of just showing charts  
- Learning real-world application flow, state handling and basic analytics concepts [web:55]

## ⭐ Featured Projects

### 📊 Interactive Data Storytelling Lab

Front‑end–only analytics lab that behaves more like an analyst than a static dashboard.

- Upload raw user event logs (CSV) directly in the browser  
- Convert them into daily active users, sessions and feature‑level usage  
- Generate plain‑language insights (spikes, drops, weak features) using editable rules  
- Simulate simple “what if” decisions (better onboarding, more engagement) and see how the curves move

### 🚗 Smart Parking Slot Booking Webpage

A front-end concept for a smart parking system.

- Landing page that explains the parking flow  
- Slot selection interface and basic booking form  
- Simple status indicators to show slot availability  
- Focus on clear layout and step-by-step user guidance

### 👀 Cute Login Characters

An interactive login page where three cute characters follow the cursor with smooth eye movement and look away casually while you type the password.

- 360° eye tracking with precise cursor following  
- Privacy-friendly behavior (side-eye “ignoring” mode on password input)  
- Glassmorphism login UI with soft gradients  
- Built with pure HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript
